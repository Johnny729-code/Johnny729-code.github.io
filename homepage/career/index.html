        <h3>This is the robot that two friends and I built for a school project! It's a completely self-made robot that can drive around using four wheels each connected to a TT motor, take pictures using a remotely-controlled camera, and track targets using simple machine learning. The robot is powered by a 7.4V battery and controls its motors and camera with ESP32 microcontrollers.</h3>

        <h3>This is the robot that I made for an introductory course at school. It's made with VEX IQ components and can pick up blocks, stack them, and store them. Please ignore me in the background telling my friend to drop the block ;)</h3>
