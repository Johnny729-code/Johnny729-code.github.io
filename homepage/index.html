                <p class="about-me-p1">Hello world! You can call me Johnny. I am a curious and ambitious international student who enjoys challenging myself with difficult tasks or problems. Although I'm interested in most subjects, I find technology the most fascinating, which is why I built this homepage in the first place - to explore and familiarize myself with web development tools like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by building real-world projects with the help of Harvard's CS50x course.</p>
                <p class="about-me-p2">I'm not only a self-taught programmer, but also a competitive mathematician, robotics fanatic, and dedicated musician. Everything I work on in my life means something special to me and is something I genuinely enjoy. You can find out more about my interests here:</p>
